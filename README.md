# 🏋️‍♂️ Gitfit 💻 

**Where `git commit` meets daily fitness commit!** 
Because why should only your codebase get all the healthy commits?

## Introduction 🚀
`Gitfit` isn't just a fitness logger; it's where the world of coding meets the sweat of workouts. Every rep, every set, and every drop of sweat gets its own commit. Watch your repo grow as your muscles do!

### Features 🌟:
- **Push-Ups & Git Push**: Log those push-ups just as you'd push your code.
- **Run the Code & The Track**: Did you just run a marathon or debug one? Either way, you’ve earned your commit!
- **Pull Requests & Pull-Ups**: Pull yourself up, and then merge that effort into the master branch.
- **Dashboard Delight**: ASCII art graphs and `console.log()` your progress.

## Boot-Up Instructions 💡

1. **Fork & Clone**:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:<YourGitUsername>/gitfit.git
    ```

2. **Initialization**: 
    - Plug into [Gitfit's Matrix](#).
    - Authenticate using your GitHub Neural Link (don’t worry, it’s just OAuth but cooler).

3. **Daily Commits**:
    - Push-ups, squats, or even a walk. Log it.
    - Post-workout selfies are the new code comments. They tell a story!

4. **Commit, Push, PR, Merge**: 
    Your fitness journey, one commit at a time.

5. **Celebrate!** 
    As the number of your commits grow, so does your Gitfit prowess. Remember, you're not just coding a project, you're coding yourself!
